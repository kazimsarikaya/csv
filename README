CVS Parser

Writes entity classes to a comma separated file.
Reads entity classes from a comma separated file, returns collection of that.

The delimeter character is only comma however it will be extended.
The type of fields should be primitive types or String for reading, for writing 
toString() method is applied. A json support for complex types will be 
developed.

Example:

Assume that the data class is like that:
    
    class Data{
        private String s1;
        private int i1;

        public String getS1() {
            return s1;
        }

        public void setS1(String s1) {
            this.s1 = s1;
        }

        public int getI1() {
            return i1;
        }

        public void setI1(int i1) {
            this.i1 = i1;
        }
    }

Initialize the parser with

    CSVParser<Data> parser=new CSVParser<deneme.Data>(Data.class, CSVParser.Delimeter.COMMA);

For reading:
    Collection<Data> datas = parser.readFromFile("datafile.csv");

For long file reading you can use the method getCSVReader
Reader has three methods. begin starts loading file, close closes file. iterator
returns the iterator of file. 

For writing:

    Collection<Data> datas;
    //init datas
    parser.writeToFile(datas, "datafile.csv");

For long writing you can use the method getCSVWriter
Writer has three methods. begin starts write to header. close closes file. And
append adds item to the file.
